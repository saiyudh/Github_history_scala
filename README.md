# Github_history_scala

## Goal
The goal of this project is to analyse the structure of the dataset its features and classes and also try to determine the contributions of each developer

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Basic knowledge of python and visualization through mathplotlib. 

## Description
We're going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

## Implementation
The activity in an open source project is not very consistent. Some projects might be active for many years after the initial release, while others can slowly taper out into oblivion. Before committing to contributing to a project, it is important to understand the state of the project. Is development going steadily, or is there a drop? Has the project been abandoned altogether?

read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala


## Results
The visualization shows how frequently the determine the contributions of each developer.
